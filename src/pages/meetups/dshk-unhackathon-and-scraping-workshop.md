      12 noon - 5pm: The good old unhackathon


      Using the data you or others collected in the morning, or that already
      collected by Dr. Freeman who will donate it just for this event, we will
      form into groups to see what insights we can gather from the data,
      learning data science techniques from each other, from visualization to
      machine learning to business thinking. All levels welcome! Only 50HKD will
      be charged to cover venue costs.
